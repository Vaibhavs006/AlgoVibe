## ✨ What It Does

🧊 **Minecraft-Style Voxels** - Navigate through a blocky 3D grid world  
🎮 **Character Movement** - Watch a voxel character find its path in real-time  
🗺️ **Three Algorithms** - Compare BFS, Dijkstra's, and A* side-by-side  
🐍 **Python Code Display** - See the actual algorithm code as it executes  
⚖️ **Weighted Terrain** - Different Minecraft blocks represent different path costs  
🎨 **Block Types** - Sand (low weight), Netherite (high weight), and more

## 🚀 Pathfinding Algorithms

### BFS (Breadth-First Search)
Explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving to the next level. Finds the shortest path in unweighted grids.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
Finds the shortest path by considering terrain weights. Perfect for cost-optimized pathfinding through different block types.

### A* (A-Star)
Uses heuristics to find the optimal path faster than Dijkstra's. The smartest pathfinder for weighted grids.

## 🧱 Minecraft Block Terrain

Each block type has different movement costs:

**Sand** - Low weight, easy to traverse  
**Stone** - Medium weight, standard terrain  
**Netherite** - High weight, difficult to cross  
**Grass** - Light weight paths  
**Obsidian** - Heavy weight obstacles  

The algorithms must navigate through these blocks to find the optimal path!
